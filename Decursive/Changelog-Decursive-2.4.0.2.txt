2.4 final release


--------------------

Archarodim:
	Decursive 2.4 by Archarodim  (2009-04-06)
	Changes from Decursive 2.3.1 to Decursive 2.4
	
	- New feature: The cool down of the curing spell to be used is displayed
	  (clock) on afflicted MUFs.
	
	- Decursive uses AceLocal-3.0 ; localization is now made using this interface:
	  http://wow.curseforge.com/projects/decursive/localization/
	
	- Miscellaneous localization updates in various languages.
	
	- Re-implemented the max unit to show option.
	
	- Added a warning when the user disables Decusive and an explanation on how to
	  re-enable it (/dcr standby)
	
	- Translations for key bindings descriptions (WoW key binding interface)
	
	- It's no longer possible to map the button 1 and 2 of the mouse to Decursive's
	  macro by accident.
	
	- Fixes a problem if the game is loaded without any "saved variables" where the
	  API GetCurrentBindingSet() would return incorrect values unusable with the
	  API SaveBindings() preventing Decursive from initializing correctly.
	
	- Bug fix: Charmed unit detection wasn't working if the player himself was charmed.
	
	- Bug fix: The focus MUF was not added at the end but just before pets.
	
	- Bug fix: The stick to right option (concerning the MUFs positions) was broken.
	
	- Some other minor bug fixes.
