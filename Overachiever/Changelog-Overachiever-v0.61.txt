- Watch Tab: Invalid achievements are now removed from existing Watch lists when the Tabs module loads. This prevents errors that could result from watching achievements that subsequently are removed from the game by Blizzard.

+ "Limnologist", "Oceanographer": Added an option to display reminder tooltips for schools of fish associated with these achievements.
- Fixed a compatibility issue with the addon MoveAnything where an error was given when the main achievement UI was first loaded if MoveAnything was used to reposition AchievementFrame.
- Fixed an issue where an error message appeared when certain tooltips were displayed.
- Trade module: Corrected an issue where uncooked recipes were treated as if you needed to cook them to earn an achievement even if the achievement was already completed. A new interface option has been added to support previous behavior, so achievement icons can be placed next to uncooked recipes even if the overall achievement is complete.
