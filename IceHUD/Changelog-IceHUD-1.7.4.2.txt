Changed paths:
   M /trunk/modules/CustomCDBar.lua

- added feature to custom cooldown bars to allow them to show/hide with the rest of the mod instead of having special rules (if desired)
- added ability to ignore a spell's range/target castability if desired on a cd bar. this allows the bars to display when a buff is ready even if it can't be cast on your current target, for example

- hopefully "fixed" (read: worked around) crash that IceHUD was triggering in the client by implementing a Lua-only version of UnitSelectionColor(). the crash was triggered by having DogTags disabled, TargetInfo enabled, and leaving an instance while in combat with one of the instance's mobs targeted (ticket #110)
