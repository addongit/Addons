   M /trunk/modules/CustomCDBar.lua

- fixed custom cooldown bars not working quite right with the 'When ready' display mode. the update subscription query was returning a false positive because a block of code in one of the CD bar's parent classes had already subscribed for updates, but the CD bar wanted to use its own update function.

Changed paths:
   M /trunk/modules/PlayerAlternatePower.lua
   M /trunk/modules/PlayerInfo.lua

- fixed PlayerInfo to only show the "buff canceling is disabled" message when a buff is right-clicked instead of any button click. also clarified the popup message to better explain why the feature is currently disabled
- hid "Low Threshold Color" toggle for the PlayerAlternatePower bar since it doesn't make sense for that module

- added an oft-requested option to treat friendly targets the same as not having a target at all for alpha purposes. this allows people who want the HUD to be hidden when they don't have a target to stay hidden when they target a friendly, for example

Changed paths:
   M /trunk/modules/TargetMana.lua

- fixed a bug where targets with rage or runic power were considered 'empty' (for alpha purposes) at 0. this was causing them to show up when they shouldn't based on alpha settings

- made custom (de)buff watcher bars respect the bForceHide option for :Show() so that they are properly hidden when a profile change occurs or they are manually disabled via the options menu
