TO DO
---------------------

* By Health Warning (Greater than/Less than)
* Text Option: Use Blizzard Font (Fonts\ARIALN.TTF)
* Turn on/off Text Only Plate (Dropdown box: Show Health Bars for: Friendly, Enemy, Both
* Friend List Feed
* Name text COLOR functions

* threat widget colors
* widget:Test() Testmode Update() function

* OpacityScale: By Raid Icon
* Color: By Raid Icon

* ShowText Option for Threat Line Widget (Allow text for either side of the tugging)

* Improve ScaleFunctionByActiveDebuffs and Opacity...
	- Create function within the Aura widget to return if the widget is active
	- test via guid, name and raid icon search

* Allow unit.guid to be fed from another source:
	- if unit.guid then GUID[unit.guid] = plate end
	This should go in the OnUpdateNameplate function, I think:
	- if not GUID[unit.guid] then GUID[unit.guid] = plate; ContextUpdate end

* Platelevels for plates(1-100), targets(127), casters(101-120), other?(121-125) 


TidyPlatesDataCache variable
* Themes: Cael, Docs

* Solution to Profiles:
* Have a button for each Theme Subconfig, and a button "Copy To Template", and "Copy From Template"

* Raid_Target_Update should trigger UpdateWidgetContext

* In addition to the optional filter function, the aura widget needs to have the timer control function exposed, too



* add new debuff filters..
	- All of Mine, Except...
	- All, Except...

* Globat CC List.  Debuff Widget to be used for CC

* Alpha and Scale functions should be passed (unit, frame)
* Extend that data to other delegates

eature Request - Friendly bars show when health <= %
(healer mode)


reduce context update load
* Reduce Double Calls
