Wikia

6.1 Revisions
................................................................................................................................

6.1.3	- Welcome 
6.1.4	- Colors reset, Welcome fix
6.1.5	- Raid Tank Coloring for "By Threat" Modes
		- Alphabetized List
		- Better handling when previous theme selection does not exist
		- Debuffs of the same spell-id are now handled more securely
		
6.1.6
		- Added Events for UNIT_SPELLCAST_NOT_INTERRUPTIBLE, UNIT_SPELLCAST_INTERRUPTIBLE
		- Added Threat Wheel to Hub
		- Reverted to original health % mode (does not show % when full health)
		- WoW 4.1 Compatibility (works on 4.0.x and 4.1)
	

6.1.7
	- Changed from thousand/million suffix for health text to using a thousands seperator
	- Restored PTR support (last time I checked)
	- Moved Quatre Raid Icon to similar position as Neon (to left side of health bar)
	
6.1.8
	- PTR bug fixes (Neon Threat Glow was turning green)
	- Debuff widget will clear aurainstance tables when combat ends (regen returns)
	- Added Health Text option: Approximate Health (will show 2 decimal places for thousands (k) and millions (M), with suffix)
	- Added Text option, "Use Default Blizzard Font"; This will use the font defined by the global variable, 'NAMEPLATE_FONT'.  This should improve the situation for non-latin charcter sets (this is for you, Chinese, Russians, Taiwanese, and Koreans.. xoxo)
	
6.1.10
	- Fixed UnitChannelInfo interruptable spell argument bug
	- By Prefix.. Mode for Debuff Widget
		- ALL, MY, NO, OTHER, CC
		- Using CC will eventually highlight the debuff on the widget, but for now it acts as "ALL"
	
-- ConvertPrefix(WidgetsDebuffList, testPrefixList)
local testPrefixList = {
   ["ALL"] = 1,
   ["MY"] = 2,
   ["NO"] = 3,
   ["OTHER"] = 4,
}		
	
local function ConvertPrefix(array, prefixList )
	local _, prefix, suffix
	for item in pairs(array) do
		_, _, prefix, suffix = string.find( item, "(%w+)[%s%p]*(.*)");
		if prefixList[prefix] then
			array[item] = nil
			array[suffix] = prefixList[prefix]
		end
	end		
end

fire an event when a nameplate is shown , hidden or created

	-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Text Plates

	- Yes, text color only changes when the unit..
		- Is attacked by you

6.2................................................................................................................................

UpdateWidget
UpdateIcon

Add a tag to the icon
UpdateIcon should put the debuff data onto the icon.
One of the data elements should be "special case" in order to handle CC type spells

* Spell Casting Colors (int/non-int)
* Graphite
* neon "friendly" style and themecustomization() function

* Texture Coordinates for Textures and Statusbar
* Spell Icon Border
* Friendly Group Member Aggro Color
* By Health Warning, By Low Health, Etc (Greater than/Less than)
* Turn on/off Text Only Plate (Dropdown box: Show Health Bars for: Friendly, Enemy, Both
* Friend List Feed?
* Name text COLOR functions
* New debuff filters..
	- All of Mine, Except...
	- All, Except...
	- All of Mine, Plus...
* Globat CC List.  Debuff Widget to be used for CC
* CC spells to debuff widget

* Mouseover/Unitid search for cast bar interruptible status
	
6.3................................................................................................................................
* Threat Widget Colors
* ShowText Option for Threat Line Widget (Allow text for either side of the tugging)
* Healer Hub

   ................................................................................................................................
* Reduce Double Calls / reduce context update load
   * widget:Test() Testmode Update() function
* Improve ScaleFunctionByActiveDebuffs and Opacity...
	- Create function within the Aura widget to return if the widget is active
	- test via guid, name and raid icon search

* Allow unit.guid to be fed from another source:
	- if unit.guid then GUID[unit.guid] = plate end
	This should go in the OnUpdateNameplate function, I think:
	- if not GUID[unit.guid] then GUID[unit.guid] = plate; ContextUpdate end

* Platelevels for plates(1-100), targets(127), casters(101-120), other?(121-125) 

* Raid_Target_Update should trigger UpdateWidgetContext
* In addition to the optional filter function, the aura widget needs to have the timer control function exposed, too

Cataclysm So Far

Hyjal I enjoyed immensly; It was like the Howling Fjords for me.  The "Regrowth" was one of my favorite parts.  Also enjoyed Deepholm, but that felt a bit small.  Went to Uldum, of course.  It's...  beautiful, of course.  I hate the pygmies.  I won't try to explain it, but I hate them soooo much.  Right from that cut scene at the intro to the zone, I hated them.  My character certainly wouldn't be taken captive my those little runts; He's soloed frost giants 40 times his size in Icecrown, and would certainly not SURRENDER to such a thing.  That pissed me off.  I stewed.

Are the encounters fun?
Do your characters feel special?  Do they feel OP in certain situations?  Do they feel unique?  Talent trees should give players the choice to be OP in ONE area.  Otherwise, it's all the same.  Use your strengths.  Water beats fire, which beats wood... Battlbeasts!
Are the mechanics of a class enjoyable?
5-mans...

Raid accessibility...

5-man regulars should help prep for end game raiding
5-man herics should be end game content, somewhat on par with raids.
5-mans to 10-man regular
5-man heric = 10-man regular
