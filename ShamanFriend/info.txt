### SHAMAN's FRIEND ### 

Author: Glyph @ EU-Sylvanas
Version 1.16+ updates by Stassart (Trelis @ Proudmoore)

This addon is designed specially for the Shaman class. It contains a lot of useful functions no matter which spec you are.

Here are a few of the functions:
 - Remind/alert for Elemental Shields and Weapon Enchants when fading or missing in combat (with sound support)
 - Show total Windfury damage with options to include advanced info: Crits, misses and which hand the procs come from. 
   If it procced of Stormstrike, the data from both hits are summed together and adds to the damage.
 - Show a message when Lightning Overload procs, optionally together with total damage and number of crits.
 - Separate frame allowing for easy Earth Shield tracking and recast
 - Show buffs removed by Purge and/or broadcast it to the chat window
 - Show spell interrupted by Wind Shear and/or broadcast it to the chat window
 - Show when your Grounding Totem aborbs a spell and/or broadcast it to the chat window
 - Show when one of your T5 bonuses procs
 - Can print messages in MSBT, SCT, Parrot and a few other places.
 - Announce to your group whenever you cast Bloodlust/Heroism, Mana Tide, or Feral Spirits
 - Uses spellID when avaible, this reduces the amount of localization needed

Of course you can choose for yourself which functions you want.
It is built on Ace3 for increased effiency and perfomance, with low memory footprint.
 
"/sf" or "/shamanfriend" to show the GUI.

### Known problems ### 
 - The time setting for the duration to display messages is not working fail safe (best is to leave it to default)
 
### ChangeLog ###
Version 2.19
 - Updated Windfury reporting for extra swing.
 - Added option to output to /say for more alerts.
 - No longer gives external alerts about CC breaking if there is still CC on the target (Still gives the shaman the warning).

 - Do not announce if Bind Elemental fails on a banished target.
 - Do not announce CC applied on a target that was already CC'd.
 - Option to not announce CC break if tank breaks after X time
   (default=10 seconds, if set to 0 will not announce tank CC breaks)

Version 2.18
 - Using Curse packager. If version 2.17 worked fine for you, no reason to upgrade. This is to hopefully fix
   any issues people are having installing this addon as it now is packaged like the vast majority of other
   addons on Curse.
