font_licenses.txt
=================

    Here is a list of all the fonts included in this SimpleMediaLib Font Pack and their associated licenses. All fonts were originally downloaded from www.dafont.com and therefore can be acquired there. Where this list gives a license of "freeware (unspecified)", there was no license given for the font in question, though it was marked as free on the download site. Freeware in this case means that all copyrights are reserved by the author, but you are free to copy, distribute, and/or use the font for personal or commercial use.
    
    Where appropriate/required, the original license file(s) have been included in the appropriate font folders.
    
    If a font has been erroneously included in this pack, or if a license would restrict its inclusion for use in the Runes of Magic MMORPG game, then it will be removed upon notification of such.
